Coding Standards for TMG:

1.  Struct/Class Names

Structures and Class names should all start with a capital
letter, followed by lower letters.  If the name is made of
more than one word, the first letter of the second word
should also be made capital.  I.E.  ExampleClass.


2.  Variable Names

Variable names are the same as the class/struct names, except
the first letter is lower cased.  I.E. exampleVariable.


3.  Brackets for Conditional and Loop Statements

All conditional and loop statements get brackets, even if
they surround one line.  The opening bracket goes on the same line
as the statement.  The closing bracket goes in the same column
as the beginning of the statement.  I.E.

if (this is a statement) {
    this is the code;
}
