You need to have GTK+ 2.4+ and ALSA installed.

Installation:

Install Dir - You can

Just a plain old make, make install.  Nothing fancy here.  

By default, the project files go into /usr/local/share/touchmegames.  However,
as of 0.2.2, the files go into where INSTALL_DIR points to in lib/config.h.

The binary goes into /usr/bin.
