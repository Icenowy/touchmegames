This is the README for touchmegames.

For installation, it's the usual make, make install.
More detailed directions are in Install.

Gtk+ 2.4.0+ is required for making the project.
A few games require ALSA for sound, if you don't have it, no
problem.

This project has only been tested on RedHat 9, RHEL 4 and FC 2, 4, 7, 8 at the moment.
I'm fairly certain that this will install and run on just about any Linux
with a 2.6 kernel.
