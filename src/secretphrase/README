This readme is for the secretphrase game.

If you want to add more phrases, go into the
phrasegenerator directory and make it, just
a make.  Then run pg(./pg).  It will prompt
you to what list you want to update.  After
selecting one, it will list the different
types for that list.  Then just insert
the phrase you want, but insert them with
all lowercase letters, the generator will
check to make sure it isn't already in there.

Phrases can contain, commas, single quotes
and dashes.
