Added touchmegames.desktop to the install.  This will allow
at least KDE to add touchmegames under the games menu.

Overall:

As graphics upgrades occur for each game, they now call
the new graphical quit dialog.

0.1.7a

Overall:

Between gtk+ versions 2.6.8 and 2.6.12, the GtkFixed widget
required the gtk_fixed_set_has_window in order to keep
it's images behind it.  So FC5+ and others with 2.6.12(or 10
possibly) showed the whole image for the altprogressbar on the 
screen, even though it was placed below 0 in the fixed widget.


--------------------------------------------------------------
